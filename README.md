# Uber-data-Analysis
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Uber ride data to uncover insights such as ride frequency by day/hour, peak times, and patterns in ride behavior.

## Project Goals
+ Understand ride distribution across days and hours
+ Identify peak ride times
+ Visualize patterns in ride frequency
+ Practice `groupby` operations and effective data aggregation using Python

## Dataset

The dataset used contains historical Uber ride information with key fields like:

+ `Date/Time`
+ `Lat` / `Lon` (location)
+ `Base` (Uber base company)
+ Extracted fields: `Day`, `Hour`, `Weekday` for analysis

## Technologies Used

+ **Python** (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, chart_studio, plotly, folium, )
+ **Jupyter Notebook**
+ **Git & GitHub**

## Key Insights

+ Grouped data by `day` and `hour` to find high-demand periods
+ Visualized ride trends using line and bar plots
+ Created heatmaps for ride density
